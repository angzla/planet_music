# planet_music

This project is a final for my algorithmic art class. I use touchdesigner and a mediapipe plugin to track my hand movements, creating an animation of a distorted picture that reacts to music. One hand affects the size, rotation, and placement of the circle while the other hand affects the noise distortion and audio.
